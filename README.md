# Customer Banking

## The Challenge

The challenge was to create 2 external code files with definitions using the class that has been provided in Account.py

## The Solution

The initial challenge was to update the definitions for CD accounts and Savings accounts in their respective files; cd_accounts.py and savings_account.py.

This was achieved by following the guidelines provided.

The next part was to take inputs from the user for the following:
* Account Balance
* Interest Rate
* Months to maturity

in order to calculate and return 
1. Interest earned and
2. New balance after interest.

Similar information is requested for both savings and cd accounts.
